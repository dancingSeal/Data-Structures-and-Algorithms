# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
- Determine which data structure (linked list, hash table, or binary search tree) has the fastest runtime and preferred performance for our course algorithm. 

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
- First psuedocode was generated for each of the data structures. Then runtime was analyized to determine which data structure was the fastest. Finally, the code was developed for the chosen data structure. 

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
- Online support, including Stackoverflow is extremely useful when coding

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
- In previous courses there has been less focus on deciding the appropriate data structure. This course is helpful, as it highlights the crucial steps prior to software development. 

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
- With more complicated code I try to explain in more detail in the comments to make the program more readable. This also makes the code more adaptable as it is easier to find the code that may need edited.
